# EasyRead
The aim that was set out to develop the project has been achieved. The application is a 
fully working result of the proposed model. It is able to recognize the text and 
summarize the text as and when the user requests it. 
From the test inputs that were tried out on the model, both the options worked as per 
the specifications. The recognized text had a few issues. But the rest were working 
well. The text-to-speech worked well and the summarizer worked too.
There is a wide range of audience that this application would benefit. After a thorough 
research into the customers that would be using this app, the following conclusion was 
drawn upon. 

● Students/Researchers – That would want to get a hold of the physical text in a 
digital form or would want to get a particular text summarized

● Visually Challenged individuals – The app would have a text to speech feature 
which would read out the text

● General group of people that would want a gist of a long text
